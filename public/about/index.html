<main>


<p><strong>XMin</strong> is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.</p>

<p>The theme name &ldquo;XMin&rdquo; can be interpreted as &ldquo;<strong>X</strong>ie&rsquo;s <strong>Min</strong>imal theme&rdquo; (Xie is my last name) or &ldquo;e<strong>X</strong>tremely <strong>Min</strong>imal theme&rdquo;.</p>

<h1 id="config-toml">config.toml</h1>

<p>For this example site, I defined permalinks for two sections, <code>post</code> and <code>note</code>, so that the links to pages under these directories will contain the date info, e.g., <code>https://xmin.yihui.name/post/2016/02/14/a-plain-markdown-post/</code>. This is optional, and it is up to your personal taste of URLs.</p>

<pre><code>[permalinks]
    post = &quot;/post/:year/:month/:day/:slug/&quot;
    note = &quot;/note/:year/:month/:day/:slug/&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>You can define the menu through <code>menu.main</code>, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>[[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;Home&quot;
    url = &quot;/&quot;
    weight = 1
[[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;About&quot;
    url = &quot;/about/&quot;
    weight = 2
[[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;Categories&quot;
    url = &quot;/categories/&quot;
    weight = 3
[[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;Tags&quot;
    url = &quot;/tags/&quot;
    weight = 4
[[menu.main]]
    name = &quot;Subscribe&quot;
    url = &quot;/index.xml&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can add <code>menu: main</code> to the YAML metadata of any of your pages, so that these pages will appear in the menu.</p>

<p>The page footer can be defined in <code>.Params.footer</code>, and the text is treated as Markdown, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>[params]
    footer = &quot;&amp;copy; [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name) 2017&quot;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="custom-layouts">Custom layouts</h1>

<p>There are two layout files under <code>layouts/partials/</code> that you may want to override: <code>head_custom.html</code> and <code>foot_custom.html</code>. This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file <code>layouts/partials/foot_custom.html</code> to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;//yihui.name/js/math-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//yihui.name/js/center-img.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can certainly enable highlight.js for syntax highlighting by yourself through <code>head_custom.html</code> and <code>foot_custom.html</code> if you want.</p>

<p>If you do not like the default fonts (e.g., <code>Palatino</code>), you may provide your own <code>static/css/fonts.css</code> under the root directory of your website to override the <code>fonts.css</code> in the theme.</p>

<h1 id="other-features">Other features</h1>

<p>I could have added more features to this theme, but I decided not to, since I have no intention to make this theme feature-rich. However, I will teach you how. I have prepared several examples via pull requests at <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pulls">https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pulls</a>, so that you can see the implementations of these features when you check out the diffs in the pull requests. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/3">Enable Google Analytics</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/4">Enable Disqus comments</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/5">Enable highlight.js for syntax highlighting of code blocks</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/2">Display categories and tags on a page</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/7">Add a table of contents</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/6">Add a link in the footer of each page to &ldquo;Edit this page&rdquo; on Github</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>To fully understand these examples, you have to read <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html">the section on Hugo templates</a> in the <strong>blogdown</strong> book.</p>

<h1 id="design-philosophy">Design philosophy</h1>

<p>Lastly, a few words about my design philosophy for this theme: I have been relying on existing frameworks like Bootstrap for years since I&rsquo;m not really a designer, and I was always scared by the complexity of CSS.</p>

<p>When I started writing this theme, I asked myself, &ldquo;<em>What if I just write from scratch?</em>&rdquo; No Bootstrap. No Normalize.css. I don&rsquo;t care about IE (life could be so much easier without IE) or inconsistencies among browsers (for personal websites). As long as the theme looks okay in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, I&rsquo;m done. Thanks to the simplicity of Markdown, you cannot really produce very complicated HTML, and I think styling the HTML output from Markdown is much simpler than general HTML documents. For example, I do not need to care much about form elements like textareas or buttons.</p>

<p>After I finished this theme, I started to wonder why I&rsquo;d need <code>normalize.css</code> at all (it sounds like a religious belief). The default appearance of modern browsers actually looks pretty good in my eyes, after I tweak the typeface a little bit.</p>

<p>Compared to inconsistencies across browsers, I care much more about these properties of HTML elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tables should always be centered, and striped tables are easier to read especially when they are wide. Tables should not have vertical borders.</li>
<li>An image should be centered if it is the only child element of a paragraph.</li>
<li>The <code>max-width</code> of images, videos, and iframes should be <code>100%</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you can enjoy this theme. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">on Github</a>. Happy hacking!</p>
