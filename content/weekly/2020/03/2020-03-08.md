I am in a dilemma at learning rust or golang, which I know a litte for the sake of labs. Matering in a specific language or, broading my skill stack is an equivalent puzzle. I have too little vigor to dig into much knowledge, like what Chuang Tzu said, 

> "吾生也有涯，而知也无涯。以有涯隨无涯，殆已；已而為知者，殆而已矣。為善无近名，為惡無近刑。緣督以為經，可以保身，可以全生，可以養親，可以盡年^[/reproduction/2020/03/the-fundamentals-for-the-cultivation-of-life/]。"

Though do not agree with part of the view of Chuang Tzu, I must admit no one can gain all knowledge in the world. What I can do is just keep learning, which brings me pleasure.

A big obstacle in front of me is procrastination. To reasonably explain this, I blame it on tools, environment, etc. Life is too short, it's time to change.
